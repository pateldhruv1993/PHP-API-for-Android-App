# PHP-API-for-Android-App
This is the back-end code for the my teams capstone project. The app is a location based messaging system on which users can broadcast their message to people in a specified radius. The android app sends users location in longitude and latitude to the server app along with the message he/she wants to broadcast and the radius. The server app then figures out what users are in that radius and sends them the message.

The server app also deals with user logins, logouts, registeration and all the other user data processing.

This repo also contains some other scripts that help you to backup data in another database and some forms and pages to help the admin to test out data without having to use the app

# Usage

Its easy to use.  Your app just needs to make requests with required parameters to this API server and in return it will give you a JSON object.
